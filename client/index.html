You've probably had a few incomplete goals in the past, so you may have convinced yourself that you aren't self-motivated - and then you've made that come true.

    You're doing OK on self-motivation. You're certainly not failing - however, you could achieve much more. To achieve what you want, try to increase the motivation factors in all areas of your life.

    Wonderful! You get things done, and you don't let anything stand in your way. You make a conscious effort to stay self-motivated, and you spend significant time and effort on setting goals and acting to achieve those goals. You attract and inspire others with your success. Treasure this - and be aware that not everyone is as self-motivated as you are!
